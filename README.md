# RL Self-Driving Car 

This project uses Reinforcement Learning algorithms (starting with PPO) to train a self-driving car in a simulated environment using torch. 

We attempt to drive a race car in a 2d track environment by having the RL algorithm tweak three continous parameters set from 0 to 1 or -1 to 1:
- The throttle
- The brakes
- The steering direction
